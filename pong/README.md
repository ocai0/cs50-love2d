# Pong

It's the classic one!

## How do i even run this?
It's quite simple
 - Download the love2d executable on your machine, and take note of where it has been installed
 - Clone this repo
 - Open the pong/run.bat file on any editor
 - Change the line where points to the love.exe file to match the one in your computer
 - click in the bat file or type `run` in the cmd (of course you must be in the folder to do that)
